         A self-taught, hybrid developer, currently based in London, passionate and always striving to learn more. Having experienced working for digital agencies, social, education, and corporate sectors, and freelancing for over eight years, and with the ever-emerging frameworks and technologies being released each year, I realised the importance of 'learning to learn'. With my absolute love for education in tech, programming interactive, and seamless applications, I believe everything is within your reach if you just work at it!
